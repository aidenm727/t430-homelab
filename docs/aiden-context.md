# Aiden Context

Generated: 2026-06-23

## Purpose

This file is an AI-readable context packet for the homelab project.

It summarizes the current state, active priorities, and operating rules so an AI assistant can quickly understand where the project stands.

## Current Mission

\# Current Mission



Phase:

Platform Expansion \& AI Workflow Foundation



Current Focus:



\- Learn and establish Proxmox virtualization workflows

\- Expand homelab capacity beyond the T430

\- Build AI-assisted documentation and context workflows

## Authoritative Sources

- docs/infrastructure.md
- ~/homelab/docs/changes.log
- Git history
- Live infrastructure state

## Operational Rules

- Deploy / Configure
- Verify functionality
- Document immediately
- Commit and push from the local machine
- Never commit secrets

## Current Priorities

1. Create and document the first VM deployment on gamer-pve
2. Continue improving the infrastructure documentation model
3. Build the Aiden Context generation workflow
4. Explore how ChatGPT Projects, source files, and future Aiden OS assistants should share context

## Known Constraints

- t430-beast should remain the stable production services host
- gamer-pve should be used for virtualization, experimentation, and heavier workloads
- changes.log currently lives only on the server
- GitHub documentation remains the canonical public documentation source

## Active Change Session

# Homelab Change Session

Started: 2026-06-23 20:55:50

## Change Title

Add change type support

## Change Type

documentation

## Intent
- [2026-06-23 20:55:50] Allow structured change records to distinguish documentation, infrastructure, service, automation, network, and storage changes

## Notes
- [2026-06-23 20:55:50] Added change type extraction for YAML generation
- [2026-06-23 20:55:50] Added change type argument parsing for start command
- [2026-06-23 20:55:50] Added Change Type section to session template

## Verification
- [2026-06-23 20:55:50] Verified default start command uses documentation change type
- [2026-06-23 20:55:50] Verified start infrastructure creates infrastructure change sessions

## Documentation Outputs
- [2026-06-23 20:55:50] Updated homelab-change.py to support structured change types



## Next Milestone

Deploy the first VM on gamer-pve and document the VM architecture using the new documentation workflow.
