# Aiden Context

Generated: 2026-06-26

## Purpose

This file is an AI-readable context packet for the homelab project.

It summarizes the current state, active priorities, and operating rules so an AI assistant can quickly understand where the project stands.

## Current Mission

Phase: Platform Expansion & AI Workflow Foundation

Current Focus:

- Learn and establish Proxmox virtualization workflows
- Expand homelab capacity beyond the T430
- Build AI-assisted documentation and context workflows
- Build foundations for Aiden OS

Current Status:

- t430-beast remains the stable production services host
- gamer-pve is online as the Proxmox virtualization host
- Immich has been deployed as LXC 200 on gamer-pve
- Project documentation has been split into infrastructure, gamer-pve, and services records
- ChatGPT project sources and instructions have been updated to match the new documentation structure

Next Milestone:

Improve generated AI context formatting and infrastructure snapshot quality.

## Infrastructure Snapshot

> Generated context artifact.
> Do not edit directly; update canonical infrastructure records instead.

## Recent Changes

- 2026-06-26 — Prototype Aiden engineering toolkit
- 2026-06-24 — Add gamer-pve node monitoring
- 2026-06-24 — Improve recent changes ordering
- 2026-06-24 — Add recent changes to generated AI context
- 2026-06-24 — Generate infrastructure snapshot from context tool

## Authoritative Sources

- docs/infrastructure.md
- ~/homelab/docs/changes.log
- Git history
- Live infrastructure state

## Operational Rules

- Deploy / Configure
- Verify functionality
- Document immediately
- Commit and push from the local machine
- Never commit secrets

## Current Priorities

1. Create and document the first VM deployment on gamer-pve
2. Continue improving the infrastructure documentation model
3. Build the Aiden Context generation workflow
4. Explore how ChatGPT Projects, source files, and future Aiden OS assistants should share context

## Known Constraints

- t430-beast should remain the stable production services host
- gamer-pve should be used for virtualization, experimentation, and heavier workloads
- changes.log currently lives only on the server
- GitHub documentation remains the canonical public documentation source

## Active Change Session

# Homelab Change Session

Started: 2026-06-26 12:02:06

## Change Title

Prototype Aiden engineering toolkit

## Change Type

automation

## Intent
- [2026-06-26 12:02:06] Begin organizing existing repository tools into a future Aiden engineering toolkit

## Notes
- [2026-06-26 12:07:09] Updated aiden-context-loader.py to summarize engineering state instead of dumping full source documents

## Verification
- [2026-06-26 12:07:09] Ran python3 tools/aiden-context-loader.py and verified it reports git status, active change session, recent changes, architecture docs, context docs, roadmaps, tools, and next step

## Documentation Outputs
- [2026-06-26 12:07:09] Updated tools/aiden-context-loader.py as the first prototype of the Aiden engineering toolkit



## Next Milestone

Deploy the first VM on gamer-pve and document the VM architecture using the new documentation workflow.
